            <p>
            I am currently a computer science student with interests in software engineering, full stack programming, machine learning and AI. I have spent much time developing proficiency in languages such as Java, Python, C/C++ and front-end focused languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have developed many projects with all of these tools, including this webpage!

            <p>
                I have great passion in the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning. I have experience utilizing machine learning tools such as Watson Discovery on IBM Cloud and Machine Learning Studio on Microsoft Azure. I have completed a year long Capstone Project in my final year of High School on Artificial Intelligence, where I showcased my own applications of AI in a college-search chatbot. At the end of my senior year of high school I was awarded the certificate for Most Outstanding Student in Science and Engineering.

            <h3>College Search Chatbot</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Trained machine learning models on IBM Watson Discovery software, to create a college search chatbot that can 
                    respond to specific questions regarding a list of 10 pre-selected popular colleges.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Worked with NLP-based models and focused on improving keyword detection and accurate responses by
                    manipulating neural network weights, biases, and inputs.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Presented the project to students, faculty, and administration to start a community wide conversation.
